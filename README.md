# Together Mobile Application

A mobile application developed with the Flutter framework as part of my thesis project at The University of Queensland, Australia.

## About Together

The purpose of Together is to help people cope with loneliness by:
  - Sending mental-health-analyzing questionnaires and collecting submissions in frequent intervals
  - Logging GPS data along with according timestamps (User's permission is required)
  
More analytical work can be done to the collected data given the amount of time I have to work on the project.

## More documentation coming soon...
